# dbt_greenhouse v0.9.0

[PR #31](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_greenhouse/pull/31) includes the following updates:

## Breaking Change for dbt Core < 1.9.6

> *Note: This is not relevant to Fivetran Quickstart users.*

Migrated `freshness` from a top-level source property to a source `config` in alignment with [recent updates](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-core/issues/11506) from dbt Core ([Greenhouse Source v0.9.0](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_greenhouse_source/releases/tag/v0.9.0)). This will resolve the following deprecation warning that users running dbt >= 1.9.6 may have received:

```
[WARNING]: Deprecated functionality
Found `freshness` as a top-level property of `greenhouse` in file
`models/src_greenhouse.yml`. The `freshness` top-level property should be moved
into the `config` of `greenhouse`.
```

**IMPORTANT:** Users running dbt Core < 1.9.6 will not be able to utilize freshness tests in this release or any subsequent releases, as older versions of dbt will not recognize freshness as a source `config` and therefore not run the tests.

If you are using dbt Core < 1.9.6 and want to continue running Greenhouse freshness tests, please elect **one** of the following options:
  1. (Recommended) Upgrade to dbt Core >= 1.9.6
  2. Do not upgrade your installed version of the `greenhouse` package. Pin your dependency on v0.8.1 in your `packages.yml` file.
  3. Utilize a dbt [override](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/resource-properties/overrides) to overwrite the package's `greenhouse` source and apply freshness via the previous release top-level property route. This will require you to copy and paste the entirety of the previous release `src_greenhouse.yml` file and add an `overrides: greenhouse_source` property.

## Documentation
- Added Quickstart model counts to README. ([#29](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_greenhouse/pull/29))
- Corrected references to connectors and connections in the README. ([#29](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_greenhouse/pull/29))

## Under the Hood
- Updates to ensure integration tests use latest version of dbt.

# dbt_greenhouse v0.8.0
[PR #28](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_greenhouse/pull/28) is a breaking change due to [upstream updates](
https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_greenhouse_source/releases/tag/v0.8.0):

## Breaking Changes
- Updated `*_id` fields in upstream `stg_*` models to be cast as strings to ensure compatibility in downstream joins by avoiding potential type mismatches.
  - Note: most IDs were previously stored as integers, so `*_id` fields in the end models will now also be strings.

## Documentation
- Added dbt documentation definitions.
- Update README formatting.

## Under the Hood
- Added an additional integration test to verify functionality when `greenhouse_using_*` variables are disabled.

# dbt_greenhouse v0.7.0
[PR #25](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_greenhouse/pull/25) is a breaking change due to [upstream updates](
https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_greenhouse_source/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#dbt_greenhouse_source-v070):

## Upstream Changes
- Updated the logic for `stg_greenhouse__tag` and `stg_greenhouse__user` to account for the presence of the singularly or plurally-named titular source tables, tag(s) and user(s).
  - The source table `tag` was renamed to `tags` for [connectors created on or after July 18, 2024](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/applications/greenhouse/changelog#july2024) and the table `user` was renamed to `users` in [October 2024](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/applications/greenhouse/changelog#october2024).
- This is a breaking change for customers with the plurally-named tables, as they have not been able to run the models previously.

- For more information, refer to the upstream [CHANGELOG.](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_greenhouse_source/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#dbt_greenhouse_source-v070)

## Under the Hood
- Added validation tests under the `integration_tests/tests` folder.

# dbt_greenhouse v0.6.0
## ðŸŽ‰ Feature Update ðŸŽ‰
- Databricks and PostgreSQL compatibility! ([#19](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_greenhouse/pull/19))

## ðŸš˜ Under the Hood ðŸš˜
- Incorporated the new `fivetran_utils.drop_schemas_automation` macro into the end of each Buildkite integration test job. ([#17](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_greenhouse/pull/17))
- Updated the pull request [templates](/.github). ([#17](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_greenhouse/pull/17))

# dbt_greenhouse v0.5.0
[PR #13](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_greenhouse/pull/13) includes the following breaking changes:
## ðŸš¨ Breaking Changes ðŸš¨:
- Dispatch update for dbt-utils to dbt-core cross-db macros migration. Specifically `{{ dbt_utils.<macro> }}` have been updated to `{{ dbt.<macro> }}` for the below macros:
    - `any_value`
    - `bool_or`
    - `cast_bool_to_text`
    - `concat`
    - `date_trunc`
    - `dateadd`
    - `datediff`
    - `escape_single_quotes`
    - `except`
    - `hash`
    - `intersect`
    - `last_day`
    - `length`
    - `listagg`
    - `position`
    - `replace`
    - `right`
    - `safe_cast`
    - `split_part`
    - `string_literal`
    - `type_bigint`
    - `type_float`
    - `type_int`
    - `type_numeric`
    - `type_string`
    - `type_timestamp`
    - `array_append`
    - `array_concat`
    - `array_construct`
- For `current_timestamp` and `current_timestamp_in_utc` macros, the dispatch AND the macro names have been updated to the below, respectively:
    - `dbt.current_timestamp_backcompat`
    - `dbt.current_timestamp_in_utc_backcompat`
- `dbt_utils.surrogate_key` has also been updated to `dbt_utils.generate_surrogate_key`. Since the method for creating surrogate keys differ, we suggest all users do a `full-refresh` for the most accurate data. For more information, please refer to dbt-utils [release notes](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-utils/releases) for this update.
- Dependencies on `fivetran/fivetran_utils` have been upgraded, previously `[">=0.3.0", "<0.4.0"]` now `[">=0.4.0", "<0.5.0"]`.
## ðŸŽ‰ Documentation and Feature Updates ðŸŽ‰:
- Updated README documentation for easier navigation and dbt package setup.

# dbt_greenhouse v0.4.0
ðŸŽ‰ dbt v1.0.0 Compatibility ðŸŽ‰
## ðŸš¨ Breaking Changes ðŸš¨
- Adjusts the `require-dbt-version` to now be within the range [">=1.0.0", "<2.0.0"]. Additionally, the package has been updated for dbt v1.0.0 compatibility. If you are using a dbt version <1.0.0, you will need to upgrade in order to leverage the latest version of the package.
  - For help upgrading your package, I recommend reviewing this GitHub repo's Release Notes on what changes have been implemented since your last upgrade.
  - For help upgrading your dbt project to dbt v1.0.0, I recommend reviewing dbt-labs [upgrading to 1.0.0 docs](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/guides/migration-guide/upgrading-to-1-0-0) for more details on what changes must be made.
- Upgrades the package dependency to refer to the latest `dbt_greenhouse_source`. Additionally, the latest `dbt_greenhouse_source` package has a dependency on the latest `dbt_fivetran_utils`. Further, the latest `dbt_fivetran_utils` package also has a dependency on `dbt_utils` [">=0.8.0", "<0.9.0"].
  - Please note, if you are installing a version of `dbt_utils` in your `packages.yml` that is not in the range above then you will encounter a package dependency error.

# dbt_greenhouse v0.1.0 -> v0.3.0
Refer to the relevant release notes on the Github repository for specific details for the previous releases. Thank you!
